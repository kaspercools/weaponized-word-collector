# WeaponizedWord-collector 

Python script to automatically retrieve WeaponizedWord data
This quick and rather dirty script, including others, was written to help with autamatically saving the WeaponizedWord lexicons as part of my Master's thesis. Further details can be found at [github.com/kaspercools/bert-binary-classifier](https://github.com/kaspercools/bert-binary-classifier)

### Developers discretion is advised
Note that this script may not be all that well written or conform to Python conventions. We quickly wrote this code to meet our needs for automatically collecting data. This script was one of a few that contributed in continuous and automated collection and processing all the information hence why we start off by writing an endless while loop.
